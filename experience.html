          <h2>Current Work & Projects</h2>
          <p>I am currently a software development intern at the Michigan Health Information Network - Interoperability Institute. 
            I began my internship as an instructional design intern and transferred to becoming the Deputy Director of Security's software intern
            after his promotion. Additionally, I am beginning my 3rd fall/spring semester as an undergraduate learning assistant for the CSE 231 - Introduction
            to Python Programming 1 course at Michigan State University. I have taught every semester, including summer semesters, for three years.
          </p>
          <p>
            Academically, I will be graduating with a Bachelor of Science in both Computer Science Engineering and Psychology
            May of 2023. I am on a 5-year Master's track for Computer Science Engineering and will be completing a thesis track. 
            This summer, I have submitted my first paper for publication at EMNLP and completed an undergraduate thesis exploring the 
            intersectionally of psychology, climate change, and computational social science.

          <h2>Past (Proffessional) Experience</h2>
          <p>In the past, I was a computational data science and full-stack development intern at NASA Glenn Research Center.
            I worked with the GVIS lab under the Aeronautics Mission Directorate on a project privately listed under the Convergent Aeronatic Solutions (CAS)
            project. While at NASA, I worked with a local library to introduce Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning to children and adults in the surrounding area. 
            I met with the National Science Foundation, and created many long-lasting relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the beginning of my career, I was a Level 2 Student Clerical Aide for the Institute for Global Health under the College of Osteopathic Medicine at Michigan State University.
            Although I have gone down a different path, I learned marketing, advertising, and basic web-design while at IGH.

          <h2>Research & Other Interests</h2>
          <p>Outside of working on projects and teaching, you can find me with my puppy or one of my three cats! I enjoy
            reading science fiction/fantasy - particularly New Adult and Dystopian series. I play far too much APEX Legends, 
            and I'm outside when the months are warmer. I am an avid bowler, as well!
